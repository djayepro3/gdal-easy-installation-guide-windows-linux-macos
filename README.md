## ✨ What is GDAL?
GDAL is a powerful open-source library for reading, writing, and manipulating geospatial data (rasters, vectors, and more).  
Many Python GIS libraries (`rasterio`, `fiona`, `geopandas`) rely on it.

---

## 🖥️ Installation on Windows

### ✅ Method 1: Install with Precompiled Wheels (Recommended)
If `pip install gdal` fails on Windows, use **precompiled wheels**:

1. Check your Python version:
   ```bash
   python --version
    ```

Example: `Python 3.13.5` → look for **cp313** wheels.

2. Visit the **GDAL Precompiled Wheels** page by Christoph Gohlke:
   👉 [Geospatial Wheels - GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cgohlke/geospatial-wheels?tab=readme-ov-file)

3. Go to the `Releases` Page
4. Find it in the `Assets` dropdown and download the wheel file (`.whl`) matching:

   * Your Python version (`cp313`, `cp312`, etc.)
   * Your architecture (`win_amd64` for 64-bit)

5. Move the downloaded file into your current direcotry on VS Code (make sure your `Virtual Environment` is activated).

6. Install it with pip:

   ```bash
   pip install GDAL-<version>-cp313-cp313-win_amd64.whl
   ```

💡 Done! GDAL is installed.

7. Check the version installed, go to section [Testing GDAL](#-youre-ready)

### ✅ Method 2: Install with Conda

If you’re using Anaconda/Miniconda:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge gdal
```

---

## 🐧 Installation on Linux

### ✅ Method 1: Install via Package Manager

On **Ubuntu/Debian**:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gdal-bin libgdal-dev
pip install gdal
```

On **Fedora/RHEL**:

```bash
sudo dnf install gdal gdal-devel
pip install gdal
```

---

### ✅ Method 2: Install with Conda

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge gdal
```
Check the version installed, go to section [Testing GDAL](#-youre-ready)
---

## 🍏 Installation on macOS

### ✅ Method 1: Install via Homebrew

If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed:

```bash
brew install gdal
pip install gdal
```

---

### ✅ Method 2: Install with Conda

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge gdal
```
Check the version installed, go to section [Testing GDAL](#-youre-ready)
---

## 🔄 Alternative: Using Docker 🐳

If installation is still tricky, you can use GDAL inside a Docker container:

```bash
docker run -it osgeo/gdal:latest gdalinfo --version
```

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### 🔹 1. `pip install gdal` fails on Windows

* This happens because no precompiled wheels are available for your Python version.
* ✅ Solution: Use **precompiled wheels** or **conda**. Go to section [Installation on Windows](#-installation-on-windows)

---

### 🔹 2. `OSError: Could not find gdalXXX.dll` (Windows)

* GDAL libraries are not on your system PATH.
* ✅ Solution: Install via **conda** (preferred) or add GDAL bin folder to your PATH:

  ```bash
  setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\path\to\gdal\bin"
  ```

---

### 🔹 3. `gdal-config not found` (Linux/macOS)

* Happens if GDAL development libraries are missing.
* ✅ Solution: Install system packages first, then install Python bindings:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install gdal-bin libgdal-dev
  ```

---

### 🔹 4. Python version mismatch

* If using Python 3.13 but no wheel exists → **downgrade to Python 3.12** or use **conda**.

---

## 🎉 You’re Ready!

Now test if GDAL is working:

```python
from osgeo import gdal
print(gdal.__version__)
```

Expected output (based on the version you installed):
```bash
3.11.1
```

---

## 🛠️ Alternatives to GDAL

If you only need high-level geospatial functionality, consider:

* [Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/) 🌍
* [Fiona](https://fiona.readthedocs.io/) 📂
* [Geopandas](https://geopandas.org/) 📊

These rely on GDAL under the hood but may be easier to install.
